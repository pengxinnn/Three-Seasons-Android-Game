RULES:

The First level:
In this level, the player uses tap to control the character in the game to avoid obstacles by
jumping; or it ends when the character hits any obstacle, and proceeds to the next level. The player
is not allowed to do consecutive jumps during a short period of time.
This simulates response inhibition.

The Second level:
This level focuses on how fast the player can handle the new command in their mind and make the
choice within the given time. The player is allowed to make at most five incorrect choices. Once
reaching the limit of tolerance, the overall score will be shown and the final level will be
initiated.
This simulates working memory.

The Third level:
The final level is made of a puzzle that need to be solved. The score earned is depend on how much time the
player spends on the puzzle, if they can. Otherwise, the game ends once the time is up, even
the player failed to get the right answer.
This simulates pattern recognition and inductive thinking. 􏰱􏰂􏰰􏱊􏰻􏰯 􏰷􏰯􏰶􏰶􏰆􏰴􏰃 􏰴􏰆􏱌􏰳􏰇􏰃􏰂􏰶􏰂􏰳􏰃 􏰯􏰃􏱉 􏰂􏰃􏱉􏱊􏱌􏰶􏰂􏰸􏰆 􏰶
